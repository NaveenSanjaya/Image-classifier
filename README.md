# AI Programming with Python Project

This repository has my submissions for the [AI Programming with Python nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/enrollment/nd089/8.0.19) offered by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/).

Please note that Udacity provided the foundation of the code for the projects.
The fundamental foundation of the code provided was a set of helper functions and tips.

My project included functions for, loading the data and transforming the data defining a suitable classifier for the chosen architecture. The tips provided were general advice on how to approach the project, such as choosing a suitable network architecture and customizing the hyperparameters.

The first goal of the project was to implement the above-described functionality in a Jupyter Notebook. This involved,
    *Writing code to read and transform the data
    *Choosing a suitable network architecture
    *Defining a suitable classifier
    *Training the neural network
    *Evaluating the neural network
    *Saving and loading checkpoints of the neural network
    *Illustrating the predictions visually with the corresponding probabilities

The project's second goal was to build a command line application allowing the user to choose different network architectures, customize the hyperparameters, use a GPU for training (if available), save and load the model, and use the model to make predictions.

The user can choose from three network architectures: vgg16, densenet, and alexnet. The user can also customize the hyperparameters, such as the number of epochs, the learning rate, and the number of hidden units. The user can also choose to use a GPU for training (if available).

The model can be saved and loaded using the command line application. The user can also use the model to make predictions on new data. The predictions are made using the predict() method of the classifier. The predict() method takes a numpy array of images as input and returns a numpy array of predictions.

The command line application is a useful tool for training and using neural networks for image classification. The application allows the user to easily choose different network architectures, customize the hyperparameters, and use a GPU for training. The application also allows the user to save and load the model, and use the model to make predictions on new data.
